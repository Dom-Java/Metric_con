VIEW METRIC COMMIT_2

This is a Metric conversion program. I selected a few converstion rates involving miles, feet, and inches. I included both their converstions to and from other metrics. This program is command line based, but I managed to add 
a few graphics with dash lines. The interactive options are based off of a Letter input system for the main menu, and a numerical input system for all menus after that. (METRIC COMMIT_2 is the most updated metric version).
